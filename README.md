# Transforming-Alphabets-into-Touch-A-Braille-Language-Project
This project maps all 26 English alphabets to Braille and displays them on a 6-segment display using six servo motors. By controlling each motor individually and using timed delays, users can distinguish letters, words, and sentences through tactile Braille patterns.
